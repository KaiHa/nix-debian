nix for Debian
--------------

The access to the nix-daemon is restricted to members of the
`nix-users` group. Therefor it is necessary to add the users that
should be able to perform nix operations to the group `nix-users`.

Users of other shells than bash need to make sure that the files
/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh and /etc/profile.d/nix.sh are sourced by their
shell.
